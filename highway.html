            <h1>Nam June Paik and His Vision of the Electronic Super Highway of Information</h1>
            <p>The world we live in today involves almost each and every individual having access to the internet at their fingertips. As a young person, this has been a fairly accepted concept for me from a young age. However, for others from generations preceding me, this is a fairly new thing that has been hard to fathom. There was a time where accessibility to a limitless amount of information seemed impossible. While Nam June Paik was a member of this generation, he managed to envision a future where anything could be possible and accessible via the internet. He saw beyond what seemed possible at the time, ultimately predicting the role that the internet plays in today’s society. He communicated his vision for the future through his work, giving viewers a glimpse into Paik’s perception of the world. In this essay, we will discuss and analyze Nam June Paik’s life, work, and what he meant when he coined the now universally known term “Electronic Super Highway of Information.”</p>
            <p>Nam June Paik was born in 1932 in Korea. He was born into wealth, as his father owned a textile manufacturing firm. In 1950, the Paik family fled to Hong Kong and then Japan in light of the beginning of the Korean War. Nam June Paik later moved to West Germany to study music history. While studying in Germany, Nam June Paik crossed paths with John Cage, a composer who would become Paik’s mentor and a key influencer of Paik’s Work.</p>
            <p>John Cage had an interest in Buddhism and encouraged Nam June Paik to incorporate orientalism into his work (something that remained present in Paik’s work throughout his career). He started off as a member of the Fluxus movement, a movement that emphasized the artistic process rather than the product itself. During this movement, Paik’s work had a performance art and music composition focus to it.  It wasn’t until 1963 where Paik’s would take a turn for what he was truly known for.</p>
            <p>In 1963, Paik began utilizing television sets in his art pieces (Park). These were first exhibited at the Exposition of Music-Electronic Television in Wuppertal, Germany. Nam June Paik truly took off his career as the first video artist in 1965, when he stepped into New York’s Liberty Music Store and purchased Sony’s first portable video camera. In A Poor Man from a Poor Country: Nam June Paik, TV Buddha, and the Techno-Orientalist Lens, Charles Park recalls the events of that fateful night that would eventually lead to Nam June Paik being named the Father of Video Art. “On the same day, he was delayed on his way home by Pope Paul VI’s precession through the city, which Paik recorded with his new camera and screened that same night to an audience in a Greenwich Village cafe. Thus began video art.”</p>
            <p>Ah, yes, Nam June Paik is named the father of video art! Plenty of artists during his era are thought of as pioneers of video art; think Bruce Nauman, Gary Hill, and Bill Viola.. However, it all comes back to Mr. Nam June Paik. He was there, opening the gates of digital art for all of his predecessors. He was the first to see the possibilities of a never ending landscape that is art produced by a screen. Televisions were Paik’s principal medium- he even created a video synthesizer, one of the world’s first back in 1969. He believed that these synthesizers would "enable us to shape the TV screen canvas/as precisely as Leonardo/as freely as Picasso/as colorfully as Renoir/as profoundly as Mondrian/ as violently as Pollock/and as lyrically as Jasper Johns" (Nguyen). He founded a new form of art that is essentially limitless, turning televisions into an artistic medium, something that was not yet considered at the time by artists and audiences alike.</p>
            <p>Written with the intent to accompany a viewer as they view “The Worlds of Nam June Paik,” the exhibition that occupied the Guggenheim back in 2000, McClelland gives an excellent summation of Nam June Paik’s life and work. He explains that Nam June Paik’s work “created a vivid metaphor of the late 20th century” through his use of video monitors, freestanding video sculptures and many video works. He provides an overview of Paik’s involvement in the New York City sixties art scene. A particular quote stands out from the abstract, encompassing Nam June Paik’s work in a very well-said manner. “Holding a magnet to the face of a TV screen distorts the picture in strange and wonderful ways. Distorting or changing our ideas about the way television or video should look or work is the central theme of Nam June Paik's art.”</p>
            <p>Nam June Paik was truly a trailblazer in the act of integrating television into the art scene. While screens and digital art is something that’s incredibly common in the art world today, during Nam June Paik’s time, it was unprecedented. This is exactly what earned Nam June Paik the title as “Father of Video Art.” He was a key figure of the discourse of art history, forever changing the way that art could be viewed. Peter Walsh, in This Invisible Screen: Television and American Art, discusses art history within the context of the rise of technology, particularly television. “Artists involved in the new media also have eroded or destroyed the stable lines of fixed artistic forms and unchanging images of earlier times. Thus scholarship has yet to evolve fully effective strategies for dealing with the artistic influences of modern media.” Nam June Paik’s work is a prime example and a direct connection to the phenomenon of television’s influence within art.</p>
            <p>With that said, the core of Nam June Paik’s work was the awareness of the influence of television sets. Paik was coming up in a society where television sets were first being integrated into every family’s home. Many people feared there would be an attachment to the screens, that TV’s were a brainwashing addiction of some sort. This was something that Nam June Paik often explored in his work. However, his work often suggested that we as a society were better off with the presence of technology, working towards eliminating that fear of technology. For example, one of his more known works, TV Buddha, explores these ideas. TV Buddha displays Buddha in meditation in front of a television set, looking at himself on the screen. It’s an ironic and funny piece, becoming a staple of Nam June Paik’s work. This work begs the question, is our society now defined by the media? Does spirituality take on new forms as our society advances technologically? He has a perplexing ability to encourage audiences to reflect on the role of media in society.</p>
            <p>There’s also an element to Nam June Paik’s work that is everlasting, an ability to find relevant pieces and messages that withstand the test of time. Hanna Holling examines different mediums of art and how they last over time, particularly art involving technology. She uses Nam June Paik’s work as a prime example. She discusses how time affects the ways in which an artist’s work is perceived. Her abstract says it best, explaining  “An event score, event-performance, object, and film drawn from the artistic legacies of George Brecht and Nam June Paik illustrate that ideas of permanence and impermanence are linked with an understanding of artworks in time and duration. While conservation reveals itself as an intervention in the temporal dimension of artworks, the theories of duration allow us to better understand the reciprocal relations between materials and meanings.” This proves true to Nam June’s Paik work as his or has remained relevant over the years, and in some cases, has gained new meaning as technology has evolved throughout the years.</p>
            <p>Holling is one of many authors to examine Nam June Paik’s influence on the integration of media and art. A chapter from Mark Amerika’s book “Remixthebook,” dedicated to Nam June Paik, containing quotes from Paik and ultimately explaining Paik’s influence, within the context of his work relating to new media. The author describes this book as “This is not a book per se. Think of it as more of a hybridized publication and performance art project that appears in both print and digital forms… featuring selectively sampled phrases and ideas from visual artists, poets, novelists, musicians, theorists, comedians, and process philosophers who have influenced my own creative practice throughout my life.” Amerika explores the subject of “cybernated” art, meaning having themes of interactivity and new media within the work. He begs the questions “Do emerging new media environments enable artists to enter a space of mind where they can play out their aesthetic potential in ways that allow them to forget themselves?” and “Is that really just a digitally networked condition or is it more of an intermedial aesthetic state of mind that transcends any specific media/mediums?” These are incredibly relevant questions to ponder on when examining Paik’s work, due to the subject matter and use of media. Amerika includes a quote from Paik himself that one can find significant to how his work is to be perceived. “Paik’s musings on the cybernatted life set the stage for a new philosophy of new media: ‘Cybernated art is very important but art for cybernated life is more important, and the latter need not be cybernated’...this means that making new media art is an important aspect to one’s overall practice, but even more important is the advancement of Creativity itself” This refers to the significance of digitized art and how it takes on a different meaning when cybernated. Screen art has become a medium in and of itself, Nam June Paik had a serious influence on this new and exciting medium. Creativity has advanced in many ways due to Nam June Paik’s ability to look outside the box and see the many possibilities that come with the advancement of technology. </p>
            <p>In 1995, Nam June Paik’s famed work Electronic Superhighway: Continental U.S. debuted at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C. This has become the piece that Paik is known for, capturing the essence of all of his work and allowing his influence to push beyond those within the art world. Electronic Superhighway is constructed of 336 televisions, 50 DVD players, 3,750 feet of cable, and 575 feet of multicolored neon tubing. All of these electronics together produce a neon image of the United States of America. Behind the neon lights, the televisions show images of media that is significant to that area of the United States. For example, Indiana is represented by clips of the Indy 500, Texas has images of cattle and cowboys, while Oklahoma is seen through Oklahoma!. At an absolutely enormous scale, aside from being an actual representation of the United States, the size is reminiscent of the large country. Electronic Super Highway is a visualization of how Nam June Paik saw the United States, media’s influence on the country, and the future he saw for the United States.</p>
            <p>Electronic Super Highway imagines the world that is freed of geographical borders by the ability of the media. Nam June Paik was inspired by the interstate highway system that he saw first put into place from a very young age, early in his life as an American. The Electronic Super Highway visualizes what one would see while traveling through all these parts of the country. Nam June Paik imagined a world where the media would defy the power of the interstate, where one could experience new things through technology.</p>
            <p>When one refers to the Electronic Super Highway of Information today, it’s often synonymous with the internet. It’s described as “a communication network provides the means to interconnect humans and machines” by Walter F. Deal, in an article called Information Super Highway Technology. This quote encompasses the impact of Nam June Paik’s work. His idea went beyond the meaning of his art piece, ultimately predicting the world wide web, something that would later impact the lives of everyone around the world, not just the United States.</p>
            <p>During the production of Nam June Paik’s piece Electronic Super Highway, the Bell Atlantic Telephone Company and Telecommunications Incorporated announced a merger that ultimately became the birth of the internet. The U.S. telephone system and the largest cable television operator at the time had intentions of creating a place where any kind of information could be available- at any given moment, to any given person. Thus, the Electronic Super Highway of Information was born. Walter F. Deal, in his article, describes how this will be accessible through “Fiber optic cables, microwave and satellite technologies will connect homes, offices, libraries, and schools together to provide a wide range of information services.” Now, 25 years later, we’ve all watched this idea unfold and become something so much more powerful than anyone could have imagined.</p>
            <p>Today, the Super Highway of Information is in just about everyone’s pocket. It’s even more accessible the actual highways themselves.  We use it in every setting imaginable; offices, schools, in the car, on the toilet… We have the ability to connect in ways that were never done before. As individuals, we have access to the news not only in our country but in places all over the world. There’s no limit to what can be found on the internet, it’s an infinite highway that has truly broken geographical boundaries, just as Nam June Paik predicted. </p>
            <p>Nam June Paik is revolutionary for seeing the world in the way that he did. From the very beginning of his career as an artist, he looked beyond what technology seemed capable of at the time and considered what it would be capable of. As the father of video art, he saw the opportunity for the screen to become a canvas before any other artist did. Using that medium, he saw a world where screens would enable us to do anything imaginable. He was years before his time, and though he passed in 2006 just as the internet’s real influence was just really rising, his vision for the Electronic Super Highway lives on in our society today.</p>
