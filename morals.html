        <h1>Where Morals Meet Duty</h1>
            <p>When it comes to our actions, what drives us to do what we do? Our intuitions? Our instincts? A gut feeling? Maybe all of the above. When it comes down to it, our actions are driven by what we believe. What we believe is right, what is wrong. Our beliefs often influence everything that we do in our life, including in our careers.</p>
            <p>In a society where a career holds a key role in each and every person’s life, what about the moments where our personal beliefs contradict with what is required of a job? Should a person be fired for refusing to perform what they genuinely believe is wrong?  Where is the line drawn between our morals and a worker’s duties? These questions and more is what I’ll be exploring in this research paper and in one of the most controversial topics in today’s society: abortion. Should doctors who are pro-life be required to perform the procedure, even though they believe it is wrong? We will explore perspectives from both sides of the argument and hopefully, come to a compromise on the subject.</p>
            <p>The abortion debate has been relevant in society for a long time, but the push for the moral rights of medical providers is a fairly new argument in the debate, giving a new important significance to the subject. It is argued that medical providers should have the right to conscientiously object to an abortion, due to their personal and religious beliefs.The subject of conscientious objection from medical providers has recently become relevant in today’s society, particularly under our current administration. According to “Trump Administration Takes Steps to Protect Medical Providers Who Oppose Abortions” by the Los Angeles Times, Donald Trump has recently made attempts to protect medical provider’s rights, particularly those who oppose abortion.</p>
            <p>In January, the Department of Health and Human Service announced that they are creating an office that “protects the religious rights of medical providers, including those who oppose abortion” (Associated Press). They go on to explain that the office will be apart of the HHS Office of Civil Rights, which “enforces federal anti-discrimination and privacy laws” (Associated Press). The intent of the group is to focus on religious and conscience rights in the federal law. This is a prime example of the current administration’s view on abortion and the steps they have taken to prevent it.</p>
            <p>The government holds an incredibly important role when determining the rights of women and the rights of medical providers. Yet, it is the rights of a woman that always seem to be undermined. The beliefs of a doctor are being prioritized before the needs of a woman. The government seems to ignore one of the most important parts of any medical procedure: the science behind it.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest arguments of the abortion debate is how a fetus is perceived. On the pro-life side of the argument, the fetus is often perceived as a human being who has emotions, feeling, and a separate life from the mother. Pro-life advocates believe that a fetus deserves human rights, more so than perhaps a woman who needs to get an abortion to save her own life or well-being. Though, According to a study done by the Pew Research center, most women allow their religious beliefs to dictate their thoughts on abortion. “Women are more apt than men to say that their religious beliefs have the most influence on their views about abortion (36% vs. 28%)” (Wormald). This study also concludes that 82% believes that abortion should be illegal, this belief coming from their religious standpoint. "Those who cite religious beliefs as the primary influence on their abortion views and those who say abortion is morally wrong are considerably more likely than others to say that there is no room for compromise on the issue of abortion," Wormald explains.</p>
            <p>This gives insight to how our society interprets abortion and where the beliefs surrounding abortion stem from. It’s important to understand that at the end of the day, pro-life medical providers are people as well. That 82% can very well include doctors or nurses. Understanding where these beliefs come from and how it affects medical providers and their patients is an important aspect of this topic. Though, on the pro-choice side of the argument, the fetus is often perceived without the influence of religion. Science plays a heavy role in how the human body is perceived and medical procedures surrounding it. In a great explanation of the procedure, Bill Nye: The Science Guy argues that people should be objective when approaching the subject of abortion.</p>
            <p>Nye finds flaws in the understanding of what a “human being” is from a pro-life standpoint. People tend to ignore that “many more hundreds of eggs are fertilized than become humans.”  Nye goes on to argue that “if you're going to hold that as a standard, that is to say if you're going to say when an egg is fertilized it therefore has the same rights as an individual, then whom are you going to sue? Whom are you going to imprison? Every woman who’s had a fertilized egg pass through her? Every guy who’s sperm has fertilized an egg and then it didn’t become a human?” He points out the lack of understanding of this concept. This lack of understanding has created an unfair system when it comes to abortion. Science should hold a bigger role in the debate of abortion, rather than political and religious beliefs. He encourages lawmakers to "look at the facts" and to "be objective," which is one of the key approaches to science.</p>
            <p>The scientific explanation essentially breaks down the concept of abortion into its simplest form. The procedure of an abortion should be looked at with an objective eye, like every other medical procedure. There are millions of eggs that are not fertilized and “die,” why does the significance of this egg change when it is fertilized? It makes sense that a physician would have an understanding of science and of biology, considering it plays such an important role in their career. Why, when it comes to abortion, do they allow religious beliefs to orchestrate what they do rather than scientific facts? One would think that a doctor should come from an objective standpoint on all subjects regarding the human body. Why does it have to change when it comes to women’s rights?</p>
            <p>There are actually several organizations of pro-life medical providers who explain their standpoints and how they conduct their work in light of their beliefs. In a biographical-style web page published by the National Association of Pro-Life Nurses (NAPN), the author gives a background to the organization. The article discloses their mission statement, how they uphold their values, and what the organization does in an effort to defend the rights of pro-life nurses and of fetuses.</p>
            <p>The NAPN claims that their organization “defends nursing and para-medical personnel from discrimination and/or job loss for refusal to participate in practices which violate these values.” They achieve this by providing lawyers to nurses who may have been discriminated in the workplace by refusing to go against their beliefs. For example, they defend nurses who have refused to give an abortion that may have resulted in the loss of their job. NAPN “involves the organization's members in the legislative process to promote life-affirming legislation.” The NAPN also claims that their organization “recognizes the value of and supports research beneficial to humanity when it is done with consideration for the dignity of the person involved and with their full and informed consent.” However, in the biography, they fail to explain exactly what “research beneficial to humanity” is. Looking deeper into their website, the NAPN didn’t provide any of this “research” or even explained what it is.</p>
            <p>While the information that the NAPN provides on this webpage gives a lot of perspective to their viewpoint and what their mission is, they fail to explain their methods behind their advocacy. There are no examples of their research and they do not provide cases that the organizations have brought to legislation, nonetheless, a case that has won. Does this make the organization credible? Is there any research to back up the idea that a doctor who refuses to give an abortion is conscientiously correct?</p>
            <p>From the viewpoint of a pro-life medical provider, a pregnant woman is viewed as two patients rather than one. A doctor wants to care for a fetus as they would any other patient and views abortion as an assisted suicide. Yet, they don’t seem to consider the instances where a woman may need to get an abortion to keep her own health in tact. In a press release issued by the American Association of Pro-life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the organization captures the viewpoint of the association and of many pro-life doctors. The report entitled “Physicians are Healers not Killers” explains that "Assisting in or directly causing the death of our patients violates the long-standing medical ethics principle of first do no harm. Killing is diametrically opposed to the role of physicians as healers." First of all, describing abortion as “killing” is inaccurate to the procedure of an abortion and is exactly what stigmatizes the act. Let’s remember what our good friend Bill Nye said and stay objective when looking at the subject of abortion.</p>
            <p>An academic essay by Cathy Gulli explains the standpoint of an established pro-life doctor, Dr. Nuala Kenny. “To Kenny, the duty of physicians to improve the quality of life through healing is incompatible with assisted death.” Kenny believes that “If death is a treatment, there [is] no patient after to see whether there's been a benefit” (Gulli). This argument seems to lack any sense of understanding. A doctor should have a comprehension of when abortion or assisted death is the best way to help their patients, regardless of getting feedback afterwards. What about other procedures? Doctors don’t act on procedures and only expect to find out if was beneficial by receiving feedback from a patient. They perform these procedures because there is a consensual understanding between a patient and a doctor that the procedure will be beneficial.</p>
            <p>One could also argue that a woman getting an abortion could be considering healing, not killing. In many cases, women have gotten abortions due to the fact that they are not physically capable to give birth to a child without threatening their own life or their children’s. In these cases, when a doctor denies a woman of an abortion, they are threatening the lives of “both” of their patients.</p>
            <p>It is also common for women to get abortions after being impregnated from rape. Under these ence, but the result that was forced upon them. The experience itself has a lasting impact on a woman, being forced to live with the result can completely change the way a woman lives her life. An abortion might play a key role in a woman’s journey to healing. Doctors and politicians need to understand and consider this when they believe the act of an abortion is wrong. circumstances, a woman is being forced to carry not only the burden from the horrible experience</p>
            <p>From a pro-choice standpoint, it is often believed that conscientious objection is not a proper excuse to prevent women from exercising their right to get an abortion. It is also believed that conscientious objection is contradictory to the job title. In “Improper Use of Conscientious Objection to Abortion,” authors Velez Gonzalez, Ana Cristina, and Laura Gil discuss this pro-choice standpoint, explaining in what ways conscientious objection is actually immoral.</p>
            <p>The paper begins by referring to a study called "The Fetus Is My Patient, Too: Attitudes Toward Abortion and Referral Among Physician Conscientious Objectors in Bogotá, Colombia." This paper is ultimately a response to the said study and the authors make that clear from the beginning, addressing this study and defining their argument. In this paper, authors Gonzales, Cristina and Urbano explain their intent with writing the paper. "Here we will argue that contrary to what this study claims, the pervasive practices they mention are not based on conscientious objection. This clarification is needed in respect to those who are objectors and also in respect to the exercise of practices based on conscience" (Gonzales, Cristina, and Urbano 221).</p>
            <p>As said in the paper, using conscientious objection targets minorities. When a doctor allows conscientious objection to interfere with the duties of their job, it interferes with a women's rights. By denying a woman the right to an abortion, they could be endangering the life of a woman who may not be able to physically give birth without causing serious problems. They could also be forcing a severely disabled child to a life of pain and misery. A doctor who conscientiously objects may be forcing a mother into a life that she is not financially ready for, punishing her and the child. These scenarios and more prove the act of conscientious objection to be unethical in and of itself. Allowing the religious beliefs of a doctor to undermine the rights of a woman who may be in danger is contradicting to the purpose of being a medical provider.</p>
            <p>This article provides a solid argument in favor of women’s rights to an abortion, ultimately coming to the conclusion that: “Conscientious objection is a mechanism aimed at protecting certain fundamental rights of providers (such as freedom of conscience and faith) or even a fundamental right in itself according to certain regulations. Yet conscientious objection must also respect the conscience of the women who request and need care" (Gonzales, Cristina, and Urbano). This addresses the hypocrisy when one chooses to defend the conscientious objection of a medical provider but not the conscience of a woman in need of care. The amount of contradiction and hypocrisy in the argument in favor of conscientious objection is often overlooked. If there is a respect for a doctor's beliefs, there should be respect for a woman’s beliefs and well-being.</p>
            <p>This particular debate seems to have very stern arguments on each side. It often seems like there is no middle ground or dialogue when it comes to this subject. The only actual way to resolve this issue, with both parties satisfied, is to find a compromise. It may seem impossible, but I believe it is reachable. It’s something that requires dialogue and understanding; something hard to achieve, but nonetheless achievable.</p>
            <p>There has been a bill introduced that resembles somewhat of a compromise on the subject. Though it has been met with controversy and mixed responses, when looking from an objective point of view, it can be viewed as a compromise. The Illinois government passed a bill, SB 1564, that makes medical providers who refuse to perform an abortion to provide a woman with a list of providers that will complete the procedure for them. This bill allows a doctor to conscientiously object and also allows a woman to receive the care she needs from a trusted care provider. (US Official News)</p>
            <p>The National Right Organization published an article in response to the bill, arguing that forcing a pro-life doctor to do this is also a violation of their moral beliefs and that “referring someone for an abortion goes against everything that pro-life doctors and pregnancy care centers believe about the sanctity of human life” (US Official News). The National Right Organization argues that this bill violates the freedom of speech. The author claims “the government is trying to compel the speech of pro-life providers--in the form of abortion referrals.” The organization feels that, by a doctor being forced to provide referrals to abortionists, the government is violating the exercise of freedom of speech and religious beliefs of doctors. The speaker goes on to explain that “In a society that is consumed with the idea of choice, the Illinois government is working to effectively deprive women of their right to choose a pro-life doctor.” This idea seems to contradict itself and misinterprets the motivation of the bill. The bill isn’t eliminating pro-life doctors from their jobs, but simply allowing them to refuse to perform an abortion and refer their patient to another provider.</p>
            <p>This statement from The National Organization, while giving a perspective from a pro-life stance, does not express empathy or understanding for the other side of the situation. They do not recognize the value of a compromise, coming from a standpoint which believes that “the thought of promoting abortion--in any form--would be a violation of conscience.”</p>
            <p>While a pro-life advocate may see this as an "obligation to a moral objection," others may view this as a compromise. A doctor can refuse a woman the right to an abortion. She has had that right taken away from her, shouldn't she at least be given some guidance to find a reliable and trusted doctor that would be willing to help her?  A woman is stepping outside her comfort zone when going to an unknown doctor, but at least she has the comfort of knowing it is a doctor that is recommended by her known provider. A doctor is stepping outside his comfort zone when referring her to a doctor who is willing to do what they morally object to, but at least the doctor isn't forced to perform what they consider to be a violation of their own beliefs. It's a give-and-take scenario, a compromise.</p>
            <p>In Australia, there is a similar law in place called the “Best Practice Standard.”   The standard entails that “conscientious objector doctors both advertise their unpreparedness to provide abortion services as well as dispense information locating alternative practitioners well in advance of any consultation”  (Badham).  A certain amount of state interference in entailed on both sides of the situation under the "best practice" standard. Badham says that "a defence of the right of doctors to deny abortion services without state interference must, therefore, be a necessary commitment of those whose cause is the autonomy of women to decide their own medical treatment without state interference, too." This standard has been met with controversy and mixed opinions from the opposing side.</p>
            <p>If this standard were to be put in place in the United States, it would most likely provoke a similar reaction. The subject of abortion is so heavily divisive in our country, but by examining arguments on each side and having perspective, we could reach this compromise. In order to reach this compromise, people must approach this issue with an open mind and a sense of understanding for the opposing argument. Once that is done, a huge step will be taken to end the divisiveness of this subject. More women will be helped. More doctors will be able to exercise their freedom of religion. All parties will sacrifice something when this standard is reached and yet, all parties will be able to go about their own lives without infringing on their own or other’s moral rights.</p>
