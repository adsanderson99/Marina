        <p>The New York City transit system. Otherwise known as, the MTA. Most hate it, but pretty much all use it. The subway is a staple of New York City culture; known for its efficiency (sometimes), scrappiness, and being the main source of transportation for those who inhabit this big city. When you step down underground for the train, you’re likely to see the diverse population that New York City is so famous for. You’ll find people on their way home, on their way to work, visiting friends, and at times, you’ll even find performers.</p>
        <p>As stated, the subway is notorious for many things, particularly for transportation and “you’ll never guess what I just saw on the train” stories. But, it’s not uncommon to hear live  music bellowing through the densely populated tunnels.While New York City is notorious for it’s transit system, it’s also known for being a hub for the performing arts. Sometime s, you don’t have to look any further than the subway itself to be right in the heart of New York’s art scene.That art scene truly reflects the diversity of the city itself, those who perform or “busk” in the subway come from a wide variety of backgrounds and genres. You may hear the smooth sounds of a saxophone, guiding you on your way to work. R&B has probably cascaded your commute to the club on a lively Friday night. Hip Hop, rock, dancers, painters, no matter the category: you’re likely to find an artist from any given genre sharing their work in one the most populated and utilized system in New York City. Like the subway system, buskers have become a staple of what makes living here so wonderful.</p>
        <p>I personally have always been very intrigued by street performers. Coming from a small town, people singing or dancing their heart out on the street is something unique to the city. There was one Dollar General in my town, pretty much the only place in Howe, Texas where you could find multiple townspeople. I’d be pretty shocked if I turned up there one day and saw a person performing outside of it. I believe I’m not alone in this feeling, street performing is something very unique to the city and very hard to come across in less populated areas. When we were told to brainstorm what aspect of the city we wanted to study in this class, street performers were one of the first populations to come to mind.</p>
        <p>I feel like there’s a lot of interesting things that one can discover by examining buskers. They see a different side of the city. They make themselves known in spaces where most people want to just keep to themselves. I’ve always wondered what exactly has driven artists  to do this. For tips? For exposure? I felt that this would be a great group to examine for Urban Ethnography as there is a lot to know about these artists.</p>
        <p>As I started my field study, I paid close attention everytime I would be in the Fulton Street subway station. This is by far the most populated station in my neighborhood and is sometimes occupied by buskers. I would listen closely to see if there were any performers present. In the recent weeks, I noticed there hasn’t been any performers, at least when I’ve been in there. This made me wonder if there’s any laws buskers face, what the trials are for these street artists. Perhaps there’s something that’s stopping people from performing in the Fulton Street station as of recent? This thought brought up other great questions that I look forward to exploring in my research. What makes a good place for buskers? Is there a certain time of day or week that works better? I had all these questions running through my head, excited to bring up these questions to a busker. As time went on, I was having no luck with finding a busker in the Financial district. Luckily, this frustration did not prevent my research.</p>
        <p>The lack of artists presented to me in the subway station over the past week brought me to my friend Hannah Hughes. She, herself, is a musician and I remember her telling me about her experiences busking once before. Hannah is from Long Island, New York. She came to the city for school here at Pace University and is a communications major. Aside from coming here for school, she came to break out into the music scene. She’s an incredibly talented guitarist and a singer, her music is mostly rock and alternative ballads. Her music is greatly influenced by artists such as The White Stripes, Ty Segall, and Pink Floyd. She is very active in the local music scene, playing every open mic and gig she can get, and even taking to the streets when she can.</p>
        <p>Hannah has busked all over the city. She’s been in subway stations and even on the side of the road. “I have busked all around New York City. I first busked off of 42nd street and sat on the side of the road. I played guitar and sang for random New Yorkers walking the streets,” she told me. “Some people gave me a dollar or two, others took my photo and put it on Instagram.”</p>
        <p>I asked Hannah about her challenges that she has faced when busking. She’s definitely had a fair share of challenges when sharing her work on the streets. “I was kicked off the street by the police multiple times. My tip is to do it in the subway station.” Hannah believes that the subway station, including Fulton street, is the best place for busking. “I went into the West 4th Street station and I got $10 from a random man. More people were tipping and listening, and it feels a bit safer.” She goes on to explain that she feels most successful during the day, finding both tips and recognition rewarding. “My tip is to do it during the day, and don’t stop. People will recognize you eventually.”</p>
        <p>My final question for Hannah was this: how has busking helped you grow as an artist? “It allows you to experience first hand the difficulty of gaining people’s recognition,” she sighed, “but if you continue to persist and play, you will have people listening.” She smiled</p>
